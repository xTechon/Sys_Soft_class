SIC base model Assembler

Usage: ./project1 [filepath]

Pass 1:
In pass 1 of the SIC base model Assembler, only a symbol table is printed.
The symbol table is stored using a binary tree data structure and is printed in alphabetical order.

The Assembler comes with a list of valid opcodes in the file "SIC_Instructions.csv" and will
not run without the inclusion of "SIC_Instructions.csv".

Opcodes are stored by reading the opcode file and storing them in a hash table for fast referencing.

The Assembler catches errors in the code and syntax such as:
- duplicate symbols
- invalid hex constants
- symbols that do not fit the Assembly Language Specification
- programs that exceed the SIC memory limit
- assembly files that contain blank lines against the specification
- word constants that exceed the maximum integer limit

Errors thrown by the assembler will list the line of the error.
Additionally, Symbols thrown with an error code less than 0 match an Assembler Directive
