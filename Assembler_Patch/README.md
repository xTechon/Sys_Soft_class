I am providing you the opportunity to submit a patch file to me. You can patch your submission and I will apply the patch to what you submitted and re-grade your project 2. Please do not ask me how to create a patch file. Please do not ask a classmate or friend or relative how to create a patch file.  I am providing you with the opportunity to fix your project 2, you have to do the work to research patch files. This is an additional learning opportunity for you!

I have created a turnin code for the patch called <br><b/>System_Software_Project2Patch_Fall2021</b>

You need to turnin a SHAR file using the turnin code above, with the following file(s):

<b/>explanation.txt</b>     - Explain to me what went wrong when I graded your project2. Then explain how you fixed the problem(s)

<b/>instructions.txt</b>     - a set of instructions that contains the steps/commands I need to use to patch your original submission using the files included in this turnin.

your file(s)              - Include the file(s) I need to apply your fixes described in instructions.txt.  DO NOT SEND ME NEW .C FILES. I WILL NOT REPLACE ANY EXISTING FILES YOU SUBMITTED.  I will only patch files you already submitted for project 2 using patch files included in this turnin. 

You must submit this using the turnin code above by November 29, 2021 at 1159PM EST.  DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. 

DO NOT E-MAIL ME ASKING ME TO TEST YOUR PATCH. TESTING YOUR PATCH MEANS APPLYING AND RE-GRADING PROJECT2.  I WILL ONLY DO THIS ONCE FOR EACH OF YOU WHO SUBMITS A PATCH. IF YOUR PATCH DOES NOT WORK OR YOU LEAVE SOMETHING OUT..THAT'S IT.

 

DO NOT SUBMIT A PATCH IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A HIGH GRADE ON PROJECT2.  THIS PATCH OPPORTUNITY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO RECEIVED A GRADE BELOW AN A. (IE: YOU CANNOT SUBMIT A PATCH TO GO FROM 90 TO 100).
