+SIC base model Assembler
+
+Usage: ./project1 [filepath]
+
+Pass 1:
+In pass 1 of the SIC base model Assembler, only a symbol table is printed.
+The symbol table is stored using a binary tree data structure and is printed in alphabetical order.
+
+The Assembler comes with a list of valid opcodes in the file "SIC_Instructions.csv" and will
+not run without the inclusion of "SIC_Instructions.csv".
+
+Opcodes are stored by reading the opcode file and storing them in a hash table for fast referencing.
+
+The Assembler catches errors in the code and syntax such as:
+- duplicate symbols
+- invalid hex constants
+- symbols that do not fit the Assembly Language Specification
+- programs that exceed the SIC memory limit
+- assembly files that contain blank lines against the specification
+- word constants that exceed the maximum integer limit
+
+Errors thrown by the assembler will list the line of the error.
+Additionally, Symbols thrown with an error code less than 0 match an Assembler Directive
+
+Pass 2:
+In pass 2 of the SIC base model Assembler, an object file was planned to be created
+
+Many things happened betweent the start of the assignment and the due date of the assignment,
+so pass 2 was not able to be completed.
+
+What was completed was only a the header record, and given a couple more hours, the Text
+record would have been finished. Once the Text Records were finished the M records would
+have only take a quarter of the time to finish
+
+As it stands it the debug outputs have been left on to show what is happening, the T records
+are not truncating properly.
+
+The plan was to have a relative head, add to that tail and then combine the Text record once
+the length was known.
+
+list:
+
+[HEAD] -> [record] -> [record] -> [rHEAD(cont. "Tadd")] -> [record] -> [TAIL]
+[HEAD] -> [record] -> [record] -> [rHEAD(cont. "Tadd")] -> [insert length here] -> [record] -> [TAIL]
+[HEAD] -> [record] -> [record] -> [rHEAD(cont. final T-rec)]
