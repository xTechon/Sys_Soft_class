what went wrong with Project 2 the first time around:

Excuses aside, my Project 2 the first time around did not compile.
In one of the strings it was missing a semicolon that got deleted right when I saved the code in Emacs
before I made a commit to my git hub and submitted it through the class server.
Even if Project 2 compiled at the time, it did not come close to meeting the project requirements,
where it would output all the debugging information to the terminal and segfault before even writing a T-record.

Solution:

After that massive problem, I have done a complete overhaul of Project 2, and fixed just about everything that was wrong with it.
I ditched my old attempt at space efficency where I tried to compress multiple linked strings that made up a T-record into a single object
in favor of not messing with the linked list too much. I have actually met the project requriements this time around too.

Other Notes:

As far as the patch file goes, it includes all of the fixes, and I had a fun time learing how to patch my project an hour before I have to turn this in.
I did figure out how to only use one patch, less steps means that many less chances of error in the instructions.
This class while tough has been my favorite in my CS track and that is not something I say about every class I've taken.

Github:

I will also include a link to the github repo in this explanation so you can take a quick look at some of the commits I made for this class and it's projects:

Thank you for this opportunity to fix my grade and have a nice Evening.
